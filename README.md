# EasyColor Extension

EasyColor is an extension to manage easily colors in your diagrams.
It makes easier to set your color preferences, and shares same colors between collaborators.
It also allows to recolor your diagrams in 2 clicks. (work in progress)

For a colorful engineeringworld !
I recommand you to makes backup of your project before using this extension until it is released.
